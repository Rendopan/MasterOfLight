Thank you for purchasing the Medieval Village!!!

You can use this for everything.

There is some minimal problems for the object because it doesn't recognize the image textures
but you can input the textures the way you wanted it. The image textures are already organized.

The roughness and the specular are not the typical image textures because I am using the older
version of blender. But the texture I've made is good as an alternative.
